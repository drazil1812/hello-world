# hello-world
My beginnings in GitHub
I am not completely new to programming, but I am new to GitHub.  I will be using the tutorials and guides to help me understand GitHub.  I am hoping to learn a lot more about working on programming projects through many different online sources in order to potentially land contract work as a software engineer.  I love programming.  I am already a contract worker employee as a music instructor, I'd like to supplement my income as a contracted software engineer as well.
